## Usage

On the 'Start Analysis' page, new *FERMO* analysis jobs can be initiated.

Files can be uploaded using the individual upload fields, and the analysis job can be started by clicking on the **'Start Analysis'** button at the bottom of the page.

The **only** file required is a **peaktable file** - all other files are optional, and all parameters are pre-filled with default values which should lead to adequate results in the majority of cases. 
Please **adjust** the parameters according to the **requirements of your data**.

*Nota bene: Due to computational restrains, the FERMO online versions employs some restrictions with regard to file size, computation time, and data storage. Details can be found on the 'Start Analysis' page.*

### Load parameters

*(Only in *FERMO* online)*

This field allows to clone the parameter settings of a previous *FERMO* job (e.g. created by a colleague). 

To load the parameters, simply paste the *FERMO* job ID into the field, and click on the **'Load Job Parameters'** button.

This job must still exist on the *FERMO* server (i.e. must not be older than 30 days). Also, files are not retained and must be newly uploaded.
