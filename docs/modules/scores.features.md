## Description

- **Phenotype score**: summarizes phenotype information assignment, with higher scores indicating higher likeliness for the feature to be associated with the phenotype. The score is determined by the highest score determined by phenotype assignment if such an assignment was performed; else, it assigns zero.
- **Novelty score**: summarizes multiple annotations of feature identity, with higher scores indicating higher likeliness for the feature to be novel. If any annotation was performed, the highest matching score is subtracted from one; else, it assigns zero.
