## Description

- **Phenotype score**: summarizes the phenotype information: assign the highest determined score (fold-change or coefficient); else, assign zero. The higher the phenotype score, the more likely it is that the feature is indeed phenotype-associated. For the [Qualitative Phenotype Module](./phenotype.qualitative.md), the score is the fold-change that was determined, while for the [Quantitative-Percentage](./phenotype.quant-percent.md) and the [Quantitative-Concentration](./phenotype.quant-concentr.md), it is the maximum coefficient score that was found across all assays.
- **Novelty score**: summarizes annotation information: if the feature had any library match using one of the algorithms, subtract the highest determined score from one; else, assign zero. The higher the novelty score, the more likely that the molecule is yet unknown.
